            <p1>What can Telemarketing do for you?</p1>
<p>Telemarketing has been around for a long time - why? Because it works!
Regardless of the techniques used, the primary goal of telemarketing is to turn leads into customers.
There are lots of different avenues available:
Creating new lists for prospect and customer data for CRM systems, 
or simply to increase brand awareness.
Ultimately, itâ€™s about creating more connections and getting more people interested

<p1>What we can do for you?</p1>    
    
            <p> Depending on your ideas, telemarketing is used as a regular on-going part of your sales and marketing strategy, or used for indivual one-off campaigns. We can work from your CRM system / data base, or we can generate new leads.
                The core of what we do is appointment setting - targeting clients, end-users, key consultants, specifiers and contractors across multiple sectors. We make the important distinction to sell the appointment not the product or service. We know that real business is done in person with the decision-maker - We just get you there.
