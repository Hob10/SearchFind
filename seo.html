            <p1>What is SEO?</p1>
<p>SEO is the art of a page ranking in search engines like Google. A website's traffic rises as a result of ranking higher in popular search engines.
As each search is the primary method that users find material online - search engine algorithms make decisions on whether users can find and visit your site, purely based upon the content of your website and other websites too. </p>
            
<p1>Why is SEO important?</p1>    
    
            <p>
SEO is important for the organic growth of your future client base. As you gradually get higher up the rankings in search engine results, your website gets more traffic and traction.
